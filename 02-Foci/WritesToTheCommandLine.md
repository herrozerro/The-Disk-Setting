# Writes To The Command Line

Most programs and users are unaware of the hidden interface that underlies the entire world.  But you have access to this secret way into the system.

Now with these skills you are often sought after to fix issues, some of them are legitimate, correcting corrupted code, or running queries for people.  But often these jobs might be illegal, stealing encryption keys, corrupting systems, assassinating programs, etc.  Life is an adventure for you because you can see the command line.

**Connection:** If this is your starting focus, choose one of the following connections.

1. Choose another PC.  Her code has a unique flavor to it and as long as you are within a long distance of her, you know where she is.
2. Choose another PC.  He has an unrecognized potential for breaking into systems.  You want to figure out if this is innate or a learned skill.
3. Choose another PC.  She has need of your abilities, perhaps she owes bits to someone, maybe she just needs to erase her past.  Whether or not you can do this remains unknown.
4. Choose another PC.  He has access to a program you want to meet.  But this program is very secretive and this PC is uncomfortable to give out the information.
