**Combat:** A bad sector is usually hidden at first and strikes unaware.  Any program that starts it's turn within an immediate distance to the bad sector is subject to a level 6 attack that deals 2 intellect damage.  

Any time the bad sector is attacked and is dealt damage, the sector jumps to within an immediate distance from the attacker and makes an attack against the attacker.

**Interaction:** A bad sector is usually the source of corruption on the disc.  Corrupted clusters are hazardous enough as it is, but the sector if repaired can restore functionality to the system.  

**Use:** The PCs are sent on a mission to investigate rumors of corruption in a data warehouse.  a few maintenance programs have been picked up glitches and their assignment is the only thing that ties them together.

**Loot:** Cleaning up a bad sector reveals 2-3 cyphers or 1 artifact.
